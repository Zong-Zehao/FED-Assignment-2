# FED-Assignment-2 Guess The Song Website
Guess The Song.io is a gamified website created for music lovers around the world to put their knowledge to the test. Users get to choose which type of quiz they feel coincides with their current listening and a song of that category is played for them giving them a time limit of 30 seconds to select from 3 options which song they think is playing. 
## Design Process
We made this website as a means of entertainment with a simple concept for our music lovers to enjoy. It is an fun and effective way for users to unwind through a universal language, music. As a user, I would like a simple solution to destress or take my mind off something without taking up too much of my time. This website is so simple yet addictive as it requires not only mental dexterity but also having time constraints that are not too stressful but just right.
